They will be responsible for the topics they choose for a selected case study and write a report on sustainability.  

Practical exercises: with the aid of scripts, students complete experiment by building new robot devices and design new circuits (e.g., clock). Practical skills will be developed by building a system with electronic and mechanical components, system testing and trouble shooting.

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>PART 1: Sustainability seminars
Seminar 1 Introduction to sustainability 
Explanation of how sustainability issues concern Electrical Engineers and practical examples. 
A detailed explanation of the sustainability framework to include law and company practices to come into force in the immediate future. 
Expansion of sustainability scope beyond recycling and low carbon emissions. 
Introduction of issues such as re-using of materials, impact of manufacturing processes to the environment and energy efficiency. 
Seminar 2 Sustainability measures Introduction to sustainability exercises. 
Students will learn, in detail, how sustainable development concerns companies along all production steps; from first materials to the end of the life of the final product. 
Seminar 3 Sustainability in practice 
Practical examples will be used to show how a detailed sustainable development exercise is contacted when examining an existing or new product. 
Students will be shown the tables drawn to show sustainability issues. 
Seminar 4 Sustainable Energy
Introduction to sustainable energy.
Student will be familiar with the most widely used sustainable sources and their related technologies.

PART 2: Soldering 
Good soldering is a skill that is learnt from practice therefore the students will solder the simple electronic circuits as a starting point.

PART 3: Build and test robot
In this experiment students will make their first electronic product. Firstly they will be introduced to the function of the different parts of the circuit such as the capacitors, transistors, phototransistors and micro-controller. They will test the function of these components by building various bits of the robot circuit. By the end of the project they should have an optimised functioning robot.

PART 4: Lecture on MATLAB
Lecture 1: Introduction to MATLAB
Lecture 2: Array and matrix operations
Lecture 3: Files, function and plotting
Lecture 4: Branch statement and program design
Lecture 5: Loops and program debugging

PART 5: Group Project
This is the most important learning exercise of the module. In summary, every student will belong to a group containing 3-5 students. The electrical engineering projects will be given to every group. The students’ idea for the projects reflects the experience during the pre-designed experiment or might be a completely new one. Students will be expected to use many of the practical skills developed in this module as well as their knowledge from other modules.
