			<tr><td><pre>The module aims to enable students to have acquired the basic skills in project management and problem solving in robotics and other mechatronics systems, as well as provide an appreciation of electrical engineers’ responsibilities in the context of sustainable development. It raises the awareness of environmental issues, and examines the principles and tools for sustainable product design.<BR>
Through presentation and oral communication skills, students acquire a practical understanding of the pressures facing the industry in terms of integrating Sustainable Design into an established product development process (e.g. internal drivers, legislation), and an appreciation of current range of tools and resources available for Sustainable Design and understand how to use some of the most common tool (e.g. Life Cycle Analysis)<BR>

This is an important module in that it improves students’ computer literacy and develops the ability to solve 'real' engineering problems by numerical methods, provides the basic building blocks of electrical circuits, and helps students correlate theory in textbooks with its practical application.

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Learning Outcomes</b><em>(for accreditation and other reasons,sub-headings could be added to this section)<br/>Students completing the module successfully should be able to:</em></td></tr>		
			<tr><td><pre>A	Show knowledge of how to use basic electronic lab equipment and design software<BR>
B	Design and construct an electronic product<BR>
C	Provide an appreciation of electrical engineers’ responsibilities in the context of sustainable development<BR>
D	Solve mathematically-oriented problems by writing simple programmes <BR>
E	Demonstrate creative in design, be able to evaluate results 
</pre></td> </tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The teaching philosophy of the module follows very much the philosophy of Syntegrative Education. This has meant that the teaching delivery pattern, which follows more intensive block teaching, allows more meaningful contribution from industry partners. This philosophy is carried through also in terms of assessment, with reduction on the use of exams and increase in coursework, especially problem-based assessments that are project focused. The delivery pattern provides space in the semester for students to concentrate on completing the assessments.<BR>
Seminars  will be given about sustainability theory, covering two case studies. Students will have team discussion sessions among themselves for the case studies. They will be responsible for the topics they choose for a selected case study and write a report on sustainability.<BR>

Practical exercises: with the aid of scripts, students complete experiment by building new robot devices and design new circuits (e.g., clock). Practical skills will be developed by building a system with electronic and mechanical components, system testing and trouble shooting.

Progress tutorial/quiz will be held to monitor the progress.

Lectures will be given on programming in lecture hall.

</pre></td></tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>Topics will typically include:
PART 1: Sustainability Seminars

Seminar 1 Introduction to Sustainability
(a)	Explanation of how sustainability issues concern Electrical Engineers and practical examples. 
(b)	A detailed explanation of the sustainability framework to include law and company practices to come into force in the immediate future.
(c)	Expansion of sustainability scope beyond recycling and low carbon emissions. Introduction of issues such as re-using of materials, impact of manufacturing processes to the environment and energy efficiency.

Seminar 2 Sustainability Measures 
(a)	Introduction to sustainability exercises.
(b)	Students will learn, in detail, how sustainable development concerns companies along all production steps; from first materials to the end of the life of the final product.

Seminar 3 Sustainability in Practice
(a)	Practical examples will be used to show how a detailed sustainable development exercise is contacted when examining an existing or new product.
(b)	Students will be shown the tables drawn to show sustainability issues.

Seminar 4 Sustainable Energy
(a)	Introduction to sustainable energy.
(b)	Student will be familiar with the most widely used sustainable sources and their related technologies.

PART 2: Soldering

Good soldering is a skill that is learnt from practice therefore the students will solder the simple electronic circuits as a starting point.

PART 3: Build and Test Robot

In this experiment students will make their first electronic product. Firstly, they will be introduced to the function of the different parts of the circuit such as the capacitors, transistors, phototransistors and micro-controller. They will test the function of these components by building various bits of the robot circuit. By the end of the project they should have an optimised functioning robot.

PART 4: Lectures and Practices on Numerical Computing (using MATLAB)

Topic 1: Introduction to Numerical Computing
Topic 2: Fundamentals of MATLAB, programming using MATLAB
Topic 3: Array and matrix operations
Topic 4: Files, function and plotting
Topic 5: Branch statement and program design
Topic 6: Loops and program debugging
Topic 7: Introduction to Simulink and Simscape
Topic 8: Introduction to MATLAB Control System Toolbox
Topic 9: Application of MATLAB, Simulink and Simscape in solving problems relevant to robotics

PART 5: Group Project

This is the most important learning exercise of the module. In summary, every student will belong to a group containing 3-5 students. The electrical engineering projects will be given to every group. The students’ idea for the projects reflects the experience during the pre-designed experiment or might be a completely new one. Students will be expected to use many of the practical skills developed in this module as well as their knowledge from other modules.
