			<tr><td><pre>Aims of this module are that sensor technology is a professional course necessary for information technology specialty. Through this module, students can understand the concept, working principle, application areas, measurement circuit and development trend of sensor technology. The aim is to cultivate students' ability to use modern electronic technology, sensor technology and computer technology to solve the problems from information collection and processing in manufacture and production, and thus lay a good foundation for the design and development of electronic measurement system and computer (microprocessor) control. The emphasis of teaching is to solve the specific engineering application problems.  Student will be able to design the measuring and controlling circuit and analyse and solve the practical testing problems by using the basic principles comprehensively. Student will be guided to recognise the professional, moral and ethical issues involved in the exploitation of sensor technology and appreciate the appropriate professional practices.</pre></td> </tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The teaching philosophy of the module follows very much the philosophy of Syntegrative Education. This has meant that the teaching delivery pattern, which follows more intensive block teaching, allows more meaningful contribution from industry partners. This philosophy is carried through also in terms of assessment, with reduction on the use of exams and increase in coursework, especially problem-based assessments that are project focused. The delivery pattern provides space in the semester for students to concentrate on completing the assessments.
Students will be expected to attend formal lectures and supervised practicals in a computer lab. Lectures will introduce students to the academic content and practical skills which are the subject of the module, while practicals will allow students to practise those skills. In addition, students will be expected to devote unsupervised time to solving continuous assessment tasks and private study.
Private study will provide time for reflection and consideration of lecture material and background reading. Continuous assessment will be used to test to what extent practical skills have been learnt. In particular, assessment tasks will be solved individually and each solution comprises the resolution, using sound programming and engineering techniques, of the given problems expressed in terms of a requirements statement.
