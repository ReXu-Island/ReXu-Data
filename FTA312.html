A.	 enable students to carry out and write up a piece of independent research in their chosen specialism ;

B.	Extend students’ knowledge, skills and critical understanding to evidence their capacity for independent thinking;

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>Each semester will involve a total of 150 hours of study, thus making this module worth 300 hours of study. 

Students will identify a research topic and meet regularly with their supervisor in order to create a research proposal.  They will then outline the proposal formally, conduct independent research, pitch their project orally and create a final dissertation.

The emphasis in the teaching will be on original, independent research.
</pre></td></tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>A dissertation is a self-contained piece of original work, submitted in place of two taught Level three (FHEQ Level 6) 5 credit modules, normally one from the first semester and one from the second semester. Students choose to study a topic of their interest guided by a member of the academic staff who will act as a supervisor for their research. Students should maintain close contact with their supervisor throughout the year. The dissertation is expected to investigate their chosen topic in some depth, drawing as appropriate on relevant published research and criticism, and constructing an original argument to arrive at explicitly justified interpretations and conclusions.   The syllabus, therefore, will be individual and co-created between the student and the supervisor.

In terms of final presentation, dissertations must be word-processed and double spaced. They are normally between 10,000 and 12,000 words in length including footnotes and a bibliography.  If a student is creating a video essay, the dissertation must be at least 30 minutes long, including final frames for a bibliography. If a student would like to produce some other critically argued media artefact, the student must agree this with the supervisor in advance.
