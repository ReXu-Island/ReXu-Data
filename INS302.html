			<tr><td><pre>The Final Year Project is designed for students to develop a piece of independent research under the guidance of a supervisor. 

While the work concludes in Semester 2 of the final year of study, preparation for research commences in Semester 2 of Year 3 in INS202 International Relations Research Methods where a research proposal is first formulated. During Semester 1 of the final year of study, students studying abroad have the opportunity to conduct some of the library research and fieldwork leading to the final dissertation in their host country. Students who do not study abroad will conduct research and fieldwork based at XJTLU. In Semester 2 of Year 4 students complete all library research and fieldwork, all of which lead to the delivery of a dissertation by year’s end.

Each student is assigned a specific supervisor at the start of the Final Year Project.

In Year 4, students are provided seminars and tutorials with further guidance on research and dissertation writing as well as an opportunity to present and discuss their work in progress.

Based on an assessed report, student projects are reviewed midway during the year to monitor progress and provide formative feedback.

Before students submit their dissertation, they deliver a presentation of their project to an audience of academic staff and fellow students. As part of this presentation, students are expected to respond to staff and student questions about their project.

Students maintain regular contact with supervisors throughout the project to receive direction and advice as needed.
</pre></td></tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>A dissertation is a self-contained piece of original work, written and submitted in place of two taught Level Three 5 credit modules. It is normally based on library research and/or a short period of fieldwork.

Students choose to study a topic of their interest, situated within the study of international relations broadly conceived.

The dissertation or report is expected to investigate their chosen topic in some depth. It should draw as appropriate on library research and fieldwork and relevant published research and criticism. An original argument should be constructed to arrive at explicitly justified explanations, interpretations, and conclusions.

Each student has a supervisor appointed from the academic staff who will act as advisor throughout their project. It is the responsibility of students to maintain close contact with their supervisor throughout the year. 

Dissertations must be presented in an electronic readable form, as well as in hard copy, with details specified in the module handbook.

The project review, which takes place midway between Semesters 1 and 2, requires the student to prepare a report according to the specifications of the module handbook.

The topic of the dissertation and the programme of research will be discussed and agreed between supervisor and student before a student departs to study abroad and formally confirmed at the start of Semester 2 Year 4.
