			<tr><td><pre>The final individual project could have one of the following three formats:
1) A traditional dissertation
2) A business plan
3) An in-house project in a company
The aim of this project module is to enable students to undertake a significant piece of independent applied research in the field of management and its related disciplines. In many ways serving as the culmination of the International MBA programme, this module provides students with opportunities to: (i) apply and integrate their learning from other parts of the programme to analyse contemporary and ‘cutting edge’ problems and issues of relevance to scholars or practitioners (or both); (ii) deepen their knowledge and understanding of a particular work-related topic of interest to them; (iii) produce a paper combining theories and their work experience from conception through to a final thesis; (iv) augment their abilities of conducting independent research,  including the skills of analysis, project management, writing and presenting; (v) make an original contribution to knowledge that could potentially serve as a basis for more advanced study or applications.Students should identify, define and explore one or more problems or issues related to business practices or at the forefront of management as an academic discipline. This may be achieved by means of either an in-organisation project, through surveys or other methods of obtaining primary data, through collection and analysis of secondary data, or by a library-based study.  The final thesis should demonstrate: (i) an analytical and critical approach to problem definition; (ii) the derivation of appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses; (iii) skills in designing and implementing a suitable methodology for gathering, analysing and interpreting data and information that address the research problem, questions and/or hypotheses; (iv) knowledge and understanding of literature and theory relevant to the area of inquiry, and the ability to apply it appropriately, and (v) the ability to write up and present the research as a dissertation or report in a way that combines academic depth and good scholarship with an appreciation of relevant practical and policy issues (as appropriate) in the field of management and its related disciplines.</pre></td> </tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The module runs during the second year of the IMBA and it covers two terms: the third and the fourth. The programme has two intakes per year and consequently also the module starts twice a year at the beginning of each semester. 
There are several elements to the method of teaching and learning on this module.
First, independent research is undertaken by the student with the support and advice of a supervisor from IBSS faculty (allocated by the Programme Director) during regular meetings and consultations that begin in the third term of the Programme. 
Second, students are expected to devote at least 590 hours of unsupervised time to private study during the entire second year of the study to complete this module.
Third, students are required to attend four seminars of 2 hours each that will be designed and delivered by the module leader. These seminars provide generic advice and guidance to students on how and issue or problem and produce a plan to address it; how to manage time efficiently and effectively to meet targets; how to locate and make use of information relevant to their project; how to design a solution to a substantial problem; how to analyse data, and how to present a dissertation and/or report.Students are required to submit a project proposal by week 6 of their third term which is summarily assessed and on which feedback is given by the Programme Director and the supervisor.  
By the end of week 14 of the third term, students are required to submit to the module leader and interim report on the progress of their project.
The final report should be submitted by the end of week 10 of students’ fourth term of study.
The oral defense of their project will be scheduled at week 13 of the fourth term of study in front of a committee chaired by the programme director and comprising at least three members of the faculty including the supervisor.
All this will serve to keep all parties concerned up-to-date about the project progress with a number of formal check-point mechanisms so that the supervisor and the module leader and/or the Programme Director are in a position to provide the students with support, trouble-shooting advice and feedback should this be required.
