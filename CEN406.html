The specific aims are to provide literature reviewing, efficient project planning and time management skills. Also, to prepare students for research or investigative work in professional engineering as well as to enable students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the techniques applicable to research or advanced scholarship in their field of study. Finally, the module aims to facilitate the effective discussion of research outcomes and drawing of conclusions as well as their coherent written and verbal communication.</pre></td> </tr>

			<tr><td><pre>This module enables students to pursue an individual research project under the guidance/ supervision of a member of academic staff. He/she will report findings both verbally and in writing. The purpose of the project is
  
•	To provide students with the opportunity to plan, carry out and control a research project at the forefront of their academic discipline, field of study or area of professional practice;
•	To prepare students for research or investigative work in professional engineering;
•	To enable students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the techniques applicable to research or advanced scholarship in their field of study;
•	To make an original and practically significant contribution to knowledge.
  
The dissertation must provide evidence of:  
•	In-depth understanding of the subject;
•	Mastery of research techniques;
•	Ability to assemble and analyse data;
•	Ability to evaluate the project outcomes. 
  
The project provides the main means for assessing whether a student meets the Descriptor for a higher education qualification for a Master's degree (Taken from Chapter A1, UK Quality Code for Higher Education) http://www.qaa.ac.uk/Publications/InformationandGuidance/Documents/Quality-code-Chapter-A1.pdf 

Master's degrees are awarded to students who have demonstrated:  

•	A systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of their academic discipline, field of study or area of professional practice;  
•	A comprehensive understanding of techniques applicable to their own research or advanced scholarship;  
•	Originality in the application of knowledge, together with a practical understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline;  
•	Conceptual understanding that enables the student:  
•	To evaluate critically current research and advanced scholarship in the discipline;  
•	To evaluate methodologies and develop critiques of them and, where appropriate, to propose new hypotheses.

  
  Typically, holders of the qualification will be able to:  
•	Deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, make sound judgements in the absence of complete data, and communicate their conclusions clearly to specialist and non-specialist audiences;
•	Demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or
•	equivalent level;
•	Continue to advance their knowledge and understanding, and to develop new skills to a high level.
  
Finally, holders will have the qualities and transferable skills necessary for employment such as the following:

•	The exercise of initiative and personal responsibility;
•	Decision-making in complex and unpredictable situations; and
•	The independent learning ability required for continuing professional development.
