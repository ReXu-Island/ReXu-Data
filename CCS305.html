			<tr><td><pre>A dissertation is a self-contained piece of original work, written and submitted in place of two taught Level three 5 credit modules, normally based on a short period of fieldwork or a placement. Students choose to study a topic of their interest within one of the program’s four areas of specialization guided by a member of the academic staff who will act as a supervisor for their research. Students should maintain close contact with their supervisor throughout the year. The dissertation is expected to investigate their chosen topic in some depth, drawing as appropriate on fieldwork/placement experience, and relevant published research and criticism, and constructing an original argument to arrive at explicitly justified interpretations and conclusions. In terms of presentation, dissertations must be no longer than 10,000 words in length including references and bibliography, and be presented in an electronic readable form, preferably MS Word.
In order to prepare students for dissertation research and writing process, the module will offer seminars on social science research methods (to be delivered by a China Studies instructor) and academic writing skills (to be delivered by a Language Center instructor). 
</pre></td></tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>Dissertation Proposal:
The proposal review which takes place towards the end of the first semester requires the student to prepare a proposal of about 1000 words specifying title, subject of research, and intellectual problem, specifying what will be done and how, particularly via fieldwork or a placement.
The topic of the dissertation and the program of fieldwork/placement will be discussed and agreed between supervisor and student early in the first semester.
The proposal will be graded by students’ supervisors. The proposals revised according to the supervisors’ feedback will be resubmitted by the beginning of the second semester. The resubmission of the proposal will be a prerequisite to the marking of the interim report (if the student doesn’t submit the revised version their next assessment won’t be marked).
The interim report will be submitted by the middle of the second semester and graded by the supervisors.  The interim reports revised according to the supervisors’ feedback will be resubmitted within 3 weeks of the original submission. The resubmission of the interim report is not a separate assessment but a prerequisite to the marking of the final draft
There will be an oral presentation of the dissertation one week prior to the submission of the final draft and will be a non-marked prerequisite to the marking of the final draft.
The research and language workshops will be marked with coursework such as in-class participation and reading reports to be specified in the module handbook.
