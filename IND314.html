			<tr><td><pre>The purpose of this module is for students to commence framing a design practice position. To achieve 
this through design practice and exploratory design making, prototyping and testing towards final 
designed products, furniture, spaces, interactions, etc respective weighting of activity in each case is 
structured within project activities to allow for differing student aptitude and interest. The end point of 
the module is intended as the springboard to inform the Final Year Project - and the realization of a 
major project of public exhibition quality. This means delivering an inspiring and substantial body of 
exploratory research, analysis and prototyping yielding a clear, emergent Design Practice and Portfolio 
identity and Professional Profile. Individual projects are negotiated by the student with a primary focus 
on the capacity to self-initiate then direct further independent study. It is necessary to navigate 
uncertainty, take risks and to demonstrate professionalism. Indicative content includes: Exploratory 
research, Concept design proposals for Products, Furniture or Spaces, User interaction, Making 
Workshop models + prototypes, Professional visualizations, Manufacturing specifications.</pre></td> </tr>

B. To develop a range of critical, technology and professional skills that are needed for ambitious and 
challenging industrial design practice <BR>

C. To reflect how design practice can improve human experience, exploring different user narratives 
and interactions as a part of the creative process <BR>

D. To be able to consider both local and global communities, where industrial design practice can 
influence change in different socio-cultural contexts <BR>

E. To develop transferable business skills for a commercial context to understand market 
performance and economies of scale and distribution. <BR>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The core learning and teaching on this module comprises a module briefing, Group tutorials, 
Individual Tutorials, Design Talks, Materials Talks, Workshop development, IT CAD sessions, 
Formative and Summative presentation sessions. Other learning and teaching methods may be introduced 
as the module progresses, if deemed appropriate by the staff team. It should be stressed that self-directed 
learning is an essential part of the university learning and teaching experience, it occupies the majority of 
time on your degree. Self-directed study is a time to work with your student peers, engage with the full 
scope of available university resource eg. library, workshops, media labs, archives, research centres etc 
and with public resources eg. museums, institutes, libraries, events etc to develop your work and 
thinking. All this work provides the material for discussion and development during scheduled contact 
hours. Your effective self-management of this time has a huge bearing on your successful progress. 
Throughout the module you will be receiving feed-forward and feedback to help you progress your work. 
This may take the form of informal tutorial or whole group discussion or similar. More formally, it may 
be issued as a written record of a tutorial discussion, or of an interim or summative review. Feedback 
may not always be directed to you as an individual, or it may be issued more broadly as a general 
commentary.</pre></td></tr>
