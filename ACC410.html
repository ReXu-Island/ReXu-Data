			<tr><td><pre>To enable students to apply technical knowledge, analytical techniques and professional skills to resolve compliance financial and business issues that arise in the context of the preparation and evaluation of corporate reports and from providing audit services.

To require students to use technical knowledge and professional judgement to identify, explain and evaluate alternatives and to determine the appropriate solutions to compliance issues, giving due consideration to the needs of clients and other stakeholders. The commercial context and impact of recommendations and ethical issues will also need to be considered in making such judgements as to appropriate courses of action.

This module builds upon and draws heavily upon the knowledge developed in the pre-requisite module, ACF426 Corporate Reporting & Auditing I. It shares many of the learning outcomes, but applies those outcomes to a widening and deepening set of knowledge of accounting and auditing standards.
