			<tr><td><pre>The aim of this capstone dissertation module on the MA International Business and Global Affairs programme is to enable students to undertake a significant piece of independent research at the intersection of the fields of International Business and International Relations. The aim of this dissertation is for students to evaluate: (i) the relevance of developments in international relations or international political economy for international business and international management, or (ii) developments in business, management or international political economy for their impact on any aspect of international relations. The module provides students with opportunities to apply their learning on the programme to analyse contemporary and ‘cutting edge’ problems and issues in global affairs of relevance to international business or international political economy; deepen their knowledge and understanding of a particular topic and/or region of interest to them; produce a complete piece of scholarly work from conception through to a final dissertation; further develop their independent research skills; and to make an original contribution with theoretical, managerial or policy-making value.
 
The dissertation must demonstrate: (i) an analytical and critical approach to problem definition; (ii) the derivation of appropriate research questions, propositions and/or hypotheses; (iii) skills in selecting, designing and implementing a suitable methodology for gathering, analysing and interpreting data and information that address the research problem, questions and/or hypotheses; (iv) knowledge and understanding of literature and theory relevant to the area of inquiry, and the ability to apply it appropriately, (v) the ability to write up and present the research as a dissertation, and (vi) the ability to combine academic depth and good scholarship on an issue with an appreciation of its relevance for business in terms of praxis and/or policy.

B. Critically evaluate and apply relevant theories to study the research topic.

C. Demonstrate an ability to conduct a research project through producing an appropriate research design, paying attention to research ethics considerations, collecting data through appropriate methods and analysing data using suitable approaches.

D. Demonstrate critical thought and depth of understanding of the political economy of global affairs or of how business and management are conducted across national borders.

E. Present findings in a coherent and logical flow as a dissertation that conforms to scholarly conventions in the study of international business or international relations.

F. Design and deliver a persuasive oral presentation that reports on the research activities completed and planned.

G. Demonstrate an ability to work independently whilst showing initiative, responsibility, self-discipline, self-motivation, self-direction and originality in tackling and solving research problems in international business or international relations.

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>There are several elements to the method of teaching and learning on this module.
  
Private and independent research is undertaken by the student with the support and advice of a supervisor from faculty (allocated by the Programme Director) during regular meetings and consultations that begin in the second half of Semester 2.  The role of dissertation supervisors is to support students during their dissertation project once the supervision is confirmed. Students will either be supervised in the Department of International Studies or IBSS depending on topic and availability.  Supervisors are expected to meet with their students and provide support in key aspects of the research project (including topic selection, literature review, research methodology and methods, data analysis and findings) periodically throughout Semester 3. The module leader will work with students and faculty to allocate supervisors based on the research proposal submitted for INR414 Research Methods for International Business. 

Students will be required to make an interim presentation during semester 3 in order to be able to receive feedback from faculty and peers on their progress and next steps.   
  
Students will be required to submit a research dissertation that conforms to scholarly conventions at Master’s level.</pre></td></tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The syllabus for this module is effectively the stages of researching and preparing the final dissertation as a research project. It will therefore vary depending on the nature of the research topic, problem and questions being investigated. However, it is expected that these stages will typically include a selection from the following:

−	The nature of research, including issues of epistemology and ontology.
−	Research ethics.
−	Alternative approaches to research.
−	Stages in planning and undertaking a research project.
−	Identifying research problems, questions and hypotheses that generate original contributions to knowledge.
−	Research methods, strategies and techniques and their evaluation, selection and application.
−	Designing and executing a research project in international business  and global affairs.
−	Searching, reviewing, and critically evaluating a body of research literature and advanced scholarship.
−	Data collection and analysis.
−	Presenting and reporting data and findings.
−	Development of conclusions.
−	Consideration of implications of findings for scholars, practitioners, policy-makers and other stakeholders.
−	Writing a dissertation that complies with standard scholarly conventions.
−	Oral presentations of research progress and findings.</pre></td> </tr>
