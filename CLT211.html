The module will broadly achieve an outcome that at times approaches near-native level communicative competencies, in particular in day to day listening and speaking.<BR>
• To consolidate and widen further the knowledge of the Chinese language and written genres including business and literary writing.<BR>
• To enhance communicative proficiency in Chinese, in both writing and oral (presentation and interaction), in genres such as for professional business or academic literature and historical study.<BR>
• To develop listening and reading skills to near-native levels of authentic business and academic texts.<BR>
• To develop a deep knowledge of contemporary Chinese business and academic culture. <BR>

All the Chinese modules have been developed taking into account the QAA benchmark statements for a full or minor component in a language. QAA benchmark statements relate to the language component comprising at least one-third of the study total, resulting in students at the end of the relevant degree programme being at level C1. These Chinese modules make up less than one third of study and so the realistic minimum that would be achieved for a student starting at a beginner level in year 1 is CEFR B2, though students with some initial knowledge would be at C1<BR>
