Engaging with a focused historical topic through reading, discussion, research, and writing will require students to use critical thinking and connect history and the present.

B. Critically relate and explain histories of Chinese and Asian architecture from a global perspective.
C. Engage constructively with complex historical issues by selecting and researching methodically, as well as intuitively, a historical object of their own choice.
D. Devise and critically analyse the historical case study as a precedent for the development of a design proposal.

			<tr><td><pre>This module has a seminar format and is organized through in-class discussion and reading of assigned texts. Lectures will provide context for discussion and reading. Presentations and individual research projects will further enhance student learning.

Some sessions on this module will be delivered by Language Centre tutors, with the aim of assisting students with language/study skills requirements for the module. Students will also be provided with online language/study skills support to help them engage with module content.

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The module addresses selected topics in recent architectural history with an eye to the global and Asian context of XJTLU, focusing on architectural events manifested in actual building as well as in critical debates. By tracing these discourses as historical signifiers, the module aims to subject architectural works produced in the past to historical scrutiny and critique. Integral to the module’s approach is an ongoing concern with the possibility of knowing and the notion of historical evidence. Students are invited to engage with these questions while focusing on a topic of their own choice. Through critical analysis and discussion, they explore and build up a body of work in preparation of the final written assignment. They engage with the moment of this recording, and they challenge the format that their documentation takes. They do so in close relation to the ongoing design studio work.<BR>

Students thereby develop critical analytical skills and, through reading, writing, mapping and discussing, deepen the appreciation of history and writing as active tools for theory as well as for design. Above all, they strengthen the ability to articulate a historical argument in a consistent manner as an integral part of the architect’s task.<BR>

Headings discussed in this context as historical questions and debates include: modernity, aesthetics, technology, practice, ideology, memory, ecology, post-colonialism, and the city.<BR>
