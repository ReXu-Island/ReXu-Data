To enhance student understanding how the real physics world works and inspire students to creatively explore hypotheses through experimentation.

			<tr><td><pre>There are seven teaching weeks, from Week 8 to Week 14. Students will be expected to attend four hours of formal lectures and class demonstrations in a typical week. During the lectures, the students will be introduced to the academic content and practical skills which are the subject of the module. In addition, students will be expected to devote six hours per week of unsupervised
time to private study. Private study will provide time for reflection and consideration of lecture material and background reading.
Students will be required to attend two sessions of physics experiments. In addition, students will be expected to research each topic before coming to the lab. The pre-lab handout and video instructions will provide the relevant background. Moreover, for each lab, students will be required to submit a formal lab report within two weeks after they complete the experiment.
