			<tr><td><pre>he aim of this dissertation module is to enable students to undertake a significant piece of independent research in the field of finance and its related disciplines. In many ways serving as the culmination of the MSc Finance programme, this module provides students with opportunities to: (i) apply their learning from other parts of the programme to analyse contemporary and ‘cutting edge’ problems and issues of relevance to scholars or practitioners (or both); (ii) deepen their knowledge and understanding of a particular finance-related topic of interest to them; (iii) produce a complete piece of scholarly work from conception through to a final thesis; (iv) augment their  independent research, analysis, project management, writing and presenting skills; (v) enhance their intellectual, transferable and employability skills and, it follows, their career prospects, and (iv) make an original contribution to knowledge that could potentially serve as a basis for more advanced study.

Students should identify, define and explore one or more problems or issues at the forefront of finance as an academic discipline. This may be achieved by means of either an in-organisation project, through surveys or other methods of obtaining primary data, through collection and analysis of secondary data, or by a library-based study.  The final thesis should demonstrate: (i) an analytical and critical approach to problem definition; (ii) the derivation of appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses; (iii) skills in designing and implementing a suitable methodology for gathering, analysing and interpreting data and information that address the research problem, questions and/or hypotheses; (iv) knowledge and understanding of literature and theory relevant to the area of inquiry, and the ability to apply it appropriately, and (v) the ability to write up and present the research as a dissertation in a way that combines academic depth and good scholarship with an appreciation of relevant practical and policy issues (as appropriate) in finance and its related disciplines.Students should identify, define and explore one or more problems or issues at the forefront of finance as an academic discipline.

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>There are several elements to the method of teaching and learning on this module.

First, private and independent research is undertaken by the student with the support and advice of a supervisor from IBSS faculty (allocated by the Programme Director) during regular meetings and consultations that begin in Semester 2. In Semester 1 of Year 2, students are expected to devote at least 30 hours of unsupervised time to private study in a typical week.

Second, students are required to take MAN401 (Introduction to Research I) in Semester 1 and MAN402 (Introduction to Research II) in Semester 2 as Additional Learning Activity (ALA).  These modules provide generic advice and guidance to students on how to specify a substantial research problem and produce a plan to address it; how to manage time efficiently and effectively to meet targets; how to locate and make use of information relevant to their research project; how to design a solution to a substantial problem; how to analyse data, and how to present a dissertation.

Third, students are required to submit a written research proposal report at the beginning of Semester 1 (Year 2) which is summatively assessed and on which feedback is given by the Programme Director and the supervisor.  The exact nature of the research proposal report will vary depending on the topic, but it is likely to include the following elements: indicative project title; introduction and background to the study; statement of intended aims, objectives and research questions; proposed data collection, analysis and research methods (including an evaluation of limitations); an overview of prior research, and current knowledge in the area of the proposed topic in the form of an outline literature review (including, if appropriate an outline theoretical framework); and a timeline for project completion. Each of these aspects will be discussed and agreed with the supervisor in advance of the student submitting the research proposal report. 

Fourth, students are expected to meet with the Programme Director at the beginning of Semester 1 to discuss the status of the research project. Later in Semester 1, students will be required to make an unassessed oral presentation on the interim progress of their research in regular seminar meetings (the precise number of which depends on student enrolment figures) in order to obtain formative feedback, comment and advice from the Programme Director, supervisors and other IBSS faculty, as well as from fellow students for whom attendance is compulsory.

All this will serve to keep all parties concerned up-to-date about the research progress with a number of formal check-point mechanisms so that the supervisor and the Programme Director are in a position to provide the student with support, trouble-shooting advice and feedback should this be required.

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The topic of the dissertation is to be approved by the Programme Director and the student’s supervisor in light of the student’s (and also the supervisor's) research interests.  The syllabus for this module is effectively the stages of researching and preparing the final dissertation as a research project. It will therefore vary depending on the nature of the research topic, problem and questions being investigated.  However, it is expected that these stages will typically include a selection from the following:

The nature of research.
Research ethics.
Alternative approaches to research.
Stages in planning and undertaking a research project.
Identifying research problems, questions and hypotheses that generate original contributions to knowledge.
Research methods, strategies and techniques and their evaluation, selection and application.
Designing and executing a research project.
Searching, reviewing, and critically evaluating research literature and advanced scholarship.
Data collection and analysis.
Presenting and reporting data and findings.
Development of conclusions.
Consideration of implications of findings for scholars, practitioners, policy-makers and other stakeholders.
Writing a research proposal and dissertation that comply with standard scholarly conventions.
Oral presentation of research progress and findings.
