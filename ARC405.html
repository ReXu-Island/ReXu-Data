			<tr><td><pre>In this studio students will develop designs based in advanced knowledge of architecture within the context of urban design and the theories and forces shaping the contemporary city. Particular consideration is given to the challenges of contemporary urban developments in China. The module aims to introduce students to specific skills and techniques used to devise urban models. Students will be introduced to the theories that have shaped contemporary cities and to different ways in which the relationships between buildings and urban context can be understood. The urban context setting of this studio aims for design proposals that integrate conceptual ideas with strategic thinking and research.
Themes are intended to reflect contemporary challenges of architecture within urban context. The studio theme creates a common platform for debate and discussion between the positions of individual students and staff as well as those of outside agencies and invited participants. The main studio theme allows for a variety of parallel studio briefs that give individual faculty, and thus students, the option of pursuing specific, yet varied approaches to the main theme. 
In the first part of the semester, the design project focuses on urban design. The developed scheme defines the framework for the architecture project to be designed in the second part of the term. The design project briefs for this studio also aim to compensate differences in skill and ability levels amongst students with varying previous training. This may include skills such as sketching, hand drawing, model making, use of digital design tools, presentation skills etc. The studio addresses a design brief within the scope of one semester. The outcome is a self-contained studio project presentation.

B.	Present an understanding of the necessity to relate buildings and the spaces between them to human needs and aspirations.
C.	Develop building design projects from the conceptual phase to the main architectural study, using a range of visual and verbal media, and in response to a brief.
D.	Demonstrate the ability to develop a conceptual and critical approach to architectural design that addresses social and aesthetic aspects.
E.	Synthesise appropriate theoretical concepts by applying them to studio design projects, demonstrating a reflective and critical approach.
F.	Present an understanding of current planning policy and development control legislation, including social, environmental and economic aspects, and the relevance of these to design development.

			<tr><td><pre>The studio project focuses on a specific theme that addresses contemporary challenges of architecture within urban context and is selected by teaching staff every year. The studio theme creates a common platform for debate and discussion between the positions of individual students and staff as well as those of outside agencies and invited participants. The main studio theme allows for a variety of parallel studio briefs that give individual staff , and thus students, the option of pursuing specific approaches to the main theme. This studio frames design as a structured and thorough form of inquiry.
Studio themes focus on contexts in which architecture addresses processes of globalization, urbanisation, climate change, human migration and the consequent growth and shrinkage of urban centres, etc. Project briefs introduce design as a form of rigorous inquiry involving the sourcing and evaluation of relevant data.
Design projects typically involve site visits and research on the site as well as on the studio theme. Students are expected to explore various techniques of analysis and investigation throughout the studio project. Students will develop detailed urban proposals for models of urban life within rapidly changing contemporary urban contexts.  Lectures and seminars on urban design and urban studies will support design studio activity and students will be expected to support individual proposals through a variety of readings. Detailed approaches will depend on the specific module briefs developed by teaching staff and presented at the start of the semester.
