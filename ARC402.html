			<tr><td><pre>This module examines the practice of architecture as a complex form of professional advocacy. The course introduces students to the basic framework of Law, building economics, procurement models and professional ethics within the practice of architecture. The profession of architecture is contextualized in its relationships to social, economic and political backgrounds as they pertain to China, UK and other countries. 
Students are encouraged to examine how buildings are planned, managed and constructed in professional practice through individual research and through seminar presentations and discussions. The aim of the module is to provide students with a solid understanding of professional approaches and behaviour. The implications of various building codes and forms of practice on architectural processes will also be discussed in a variety of formats, among students, teaching staff and invited guests.

C Account for designs that will meet building users’ requirements and comply with relevant legislation, appropriate performance standards and health and safety requirements.

D Build up a demonstrable ability to identify individual learning needs and understand the personal professional responsibility required to prepare for qualification as an architect.

E Suggest moral and ethical responses to a variety of hypothetical practical situations with which architects are commonly confronted.

			<tr><td><pre>The module covers two main aspects of professional practice: Providing students with a broad understanding of existing duties and requirements of professional architectural practice in China and the UK among others and a reflection on the implications of such practice on architectural design. The module exercises students’ capacity for professional judgment. It provides a basis for the development of professional, social, political and commercial abilities appropriate to the identification and procurement of state or privately funded work related to the activities of the construction and property industries, the legal and financial professions and regulatory bodies.<BR>
The module will cover: The process of building construction, building laws, contracts, project and construction management, technical documentation, building economics, the various roles of architects in the building process, professional ethics (professional codes and liability), different forms of management practices, regulatory practices (sustainability, energy, health and safety).<BR>
The module provides the possibility for a variety of settings for teaching and learning, including lectures, seminar discussions, and lectures by invited guests as well as field trips<BR>
