			<tr><td><pre>A list of project areas proposed by members of staff is distributed in August and students may consult the supervisors of projects that interest them. In addition, students may suggest project ideas for themselves. Students submit their ranked choice of project areas and projects are allocated on the basis of this choice. Students are notified of the project allocated at the beginning of term.

Skills imparted through lecture, practical, and Key Skills are developed further in the project. This is done through close and regular contact with supervisors (with formal progress meetings being recorded) and relevant research staff and augmented by personal experience in the laboratory, or elsewhere. 

It is expected that 2 to 2.5 days a week should be spent on the project during Semesters 1 and 2 and the supervisor is consulted regularly.

			<tr><td><pre>The project is undertaken as either a laboratory-based, field-based, or CID-based exercise which extends over two semesters. Each project is supervised formally by a member of academic staff, although day to day supervision and advice may be provided by a member of research/technical staff, or a postgraduate research student. Talks by staff at the beginning of the project provide training and information about project management and safety. Early in Semester 1, students are expected to undertake a thorough review of the relevant literature and to submit a Preliminary Report that includes the literature review, the aims and objectives of the project, including a hypothesis as appropriate, and a timetable and plan of work. Students are then introduced to and are expected to execute, research relevant to their project and have regular meetings with their supervisor to evaluate progress and plan future work. A Final Report is submitted and an oral presentation given at the end of Semester 2. A project report book is maintained and presented regularly to the supervisor for inspection.</pre></td> </tr>
