			<tr><td><pre>This optional module runs across two semesters and is aimed at students who want to take up screenwriting seriously.  It builds on the work that they have done at Level 4 in their Screenwrting module.  The module provides an opportunity to the serious screen-writer to explore their craft by understanding the demands made on them by the profession of screenwriting.<BR>

Specifically, the module is designed to:<BR>
Enable student writers to further explore the relationship between the visual medium and the craft of storytelling<BR>
Give student writers a greater understanding of the theories and principles of writing fiction by producing coverage reports that examine scripts already written and films already made<BR>
Develop the ability to write treatements and pitch projects to industry <BR>
Find their creative voice by writing screenplays using professional software
Gain an understanding of writer contracts, fees, negotiations etc. so that they can conduct themselves at a professional level.<BR>

B	Research and engage in the professional development process of screenwriting, including engaging in a writer’s recce<BR>
C	Pitch screenplays both verbally and by creating a professional treatment <BR>
D	Understand and apply the craft skills involved in writing for film by conceiving, developing and writing both a short film screenplay, and a longer, fuller script using industry standard software
<BR></pre></td> </tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>There are no lectures for this module.  Instead, there are intensive weekly 3 hour seminars where films will be viewed, analysed and coverage reports produced.  Each semester will involve a total of 150 hours of study, thus making this module worth 300 hours of study. <BR>

The seminars will also concentrate on the craft of writing and polishing scripts.<BR>

During the writing periods, the seminars may be replaced with writing tasks.<BR>
</pre></td></tr>

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Syllabus</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>The seminar sessions will cover a range of topics that will enable students to engage with the principles of screenwriting; to understand the marketplace for their screenplays and to appreciate the principles of fees, contracts, agents, industry script development schemes etc. so that they will be able to operate in a fast-moving industry. <BR>
They will be made aware of the need to be professional at all times, understanding that writing is all about re- writing.  <BR>
Typically, the syllabus will cover some of the following topics: <BR>
An exploration of the writer’s journey, helping students to ‘find’ their voice <BR>
Coverage reports and their importance in industry <BR>
The importance of taking audience and marketplace into consideration while embarking on screenplay writing <BR>
Professional development of screenwriters in the world and in China, examining the scope of contracts, fees, drafts, writes and re-writes and script development schemes <BR>
Pitching projects as the writer of a project
