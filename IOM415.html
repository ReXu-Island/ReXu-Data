			<tr><td><pre>The aim of this dissertation module is to enable students to undertake a significant piece of independent research in the fields of operations and supply chain management.  

This module provides students with opportunities to: (i) apply their learning from other parts of the programme to analyse contemporary and ‘cutting edge’ problems and issues of relevance to scholars or practitioners (or both); (ii) deepen their knowledge and understanding of a particular programme related topic of interest to them; (iii) produce a complete piece of scholarly work from conception through to a final thesis; (iv) augment their independent research, analysis, project management, writing and presenting skills; (v) enhance their intellectual, transferable and employability skills and, it follows, their career prospects, and (iv) make an original contribution to knowledge that could potentially serve as a basis for more advanced study. 

Students should identify, define and explore one or more problems or issues at the forefront of operations and supply chain management as an academic and applied discipline. This may be achieved by means of: 
-	an in-organization project through the use of analytical techniques, the novel application of existing approaches or the development of new approaches for identifying and addressing the organization’s issues ,  
-	or through surveys or other methods of obtaining primary data, and/or 
-	through collection and analysis of secondary data and library-based study. 

The final thesis should demonstrate:  
(i)	an analytical and critical approach to problem definition;  
(ii)	the derivation of appropriate research questions and/or hypotheses;  
(iii)	skills in designing and implementing a suitable methodology for gathering, analysing and interpreting data and information that address the research problem, questions and/or hypotheses;  (iv)	knowledge and understanding of literature and theory relevant to the area of inquiry, and the ability to apply it appropriately, and/or
(v)	where applicable the successful implementation of new or existing tools
(vi)	the ability to write up and present the research as a dissertation in a way that combines academic depth and good scholarship with an appreciation of relevant practical and policy issues (as appropriate) in operations and supply chain management and its related disc

			<tr><td bgcolor="#ADD8E6"><b>Method of Teaching and Learning</b></td></tr>	
			<tr><td><pre>A.	Fulltime Programme

There are several elements to the method of teaching and learning on this module.

1.	Students are required to take MAN901 (Introduction to Research I) in Semester 1 and MAN902 (Introduction to Research II) in Semester 2 as an Additional Learning Activity (ALA).  These modules provide generic advice and guidance to students on how to specify a substantial research problem and produce a plan to address it; how to manage time efficiently and effectively to meet targets; how to locate and make use of information relevant to their research project; how to design a solution to a substantial problem; how to analyse data, and how to present a dissertation.

2.	In semester two, potential supervisors are asked to submit a proposal form for each dissertation topic with a brief description of the type of dissertation (e.g. desk based, in-organization, empirical), the specific targets and any additional resources required.  These are collated and a list is distributed to students.  Students are given three choices from the list. The selection process is based on the overall average marks awarded in the first semester and if there are any pre-requisites modules for selecting a particular dissertation topic. Students with higher marks get their first choice.  Students are also permitted to identify their own dissertation topic but will have to seek approval from the programme director and find a suitable member of faculty to supervise the project. 

It is expected that by the end of semester 2, the student is able to draft a research proposal to submit to the supervisor for feedback as well as the necessary completed forms if the proposed project requires approval from the ethics committee.
3.	The student is required to submit a complete research proposal no later than Friday of the first week of semester 1 in year two of study that is 10% of the overall module mark.  The proposal should cover in detail, project description, expected outcomes, literature review, methodology, plan and if applicable approval by the ethics committee.  The proposal is assessed by the supervisor and an independent marker and feedback is given to the student within one week and copied to the programme director and module leader.  The proposal is expected to be approximately 3000 words.

4.	Private and independent research is undertaken by the student with the support and advice from the supervisor from IBSS faculty and an organization facilitator where the dissertation is an in-organization project, during regular meetings and consultations that begin in Semester 2.  The student is expected to report weekly to the supervisor either in person or by email.

In Semester 1 of Year 2, students are expected to devote at least 30 hours of unsupervised time to private study in a typical week.

5.	Students are expected to meet with the Programme Director or dissertation module leader at the beginning of Semester 1 to discuss the status and progress of the dissertation.

6.	Students will be required to give an assessed oral presentation representing 15% of the module mark that is at the middle of semester 1 in Year 2 covering the progress of the project against the proposal plan and any results and analysis carried so far. This will be attended by the two nominated markers, the supervisor and programme director and/or dissertation module leader.

Since none of the dissertation markers are the supervisor, this presentation provides the student with the opportunity to receive formative feedback to address any issues or reservations the markers might have to the approach adopted by the student before the submission of the final dissertation.
7.	The final dissertation is due on the Monday of week 13 of semester 1 year 2 and this represents 75% of the overall mark and will be assessed by two markers normally neither are the supervisor. In cases of a highly specialized research topics where two independent markers are not available then the supervisor will act as one of the markers.
